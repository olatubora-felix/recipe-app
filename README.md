**Project Rquirement**


A client, Miss Ore, wants a food project done for her business portfolio. She doesnâ€™t mind a rough implementation - She just needs her users to look up any recipe on your web application. As a nutritionist, she wants the calorie count for the corresponding recipe.

Also, she proposed a cost calculator for each looked-up recipe; she's okay if it is some random amount. Although, she is keen on having this cost (in naira) converted to USD, that reflects on the live conversion rate at any given time. Ore insisted this conversion be displayed as a popup with a click of a button. Fred is our UI/UX guy - he proposed you have a button alongside the cost (in naira) with a description "Click to see USD price" for this popup.

Additionally, she wants a dedicated page where her users can look up restaurants near them, using the current location.

FRIENDLY NOTE: Fred just started his UI/UX journey. He's not as good as he would like, but we think he's alright. We like Fred.
Side note: Ore is a big fan of Animation, especially Lotties! She also likes Card styling, Grid styling, and the color Purple.
